# Hit effect

This is a hit effect created in HTML5 canvas with TypeScript. 
This project has been once again inspired by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/neipo13/status/1208607662159609862). 

## So, how is this useful?
It isn't

## Okay, why did you create it then?
yes

## No, but seriously, why?
Because I thought I could also create this effect by using only mathematics to calculate the color of every pixel.

## Is that why it is so slow with high resolution?
Oh no no no, that is dependent of the position of the moon.
